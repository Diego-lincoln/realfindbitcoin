# realfindbitcoin
TThis system has the real ability to find real bitcoins and has currently located 18 wallets with balances. Anyone can find real bitcoins using this system and running it locally. 
This information will change everything you know about how to truly find bitcoin private keys and passkeys, as it uses eleven repeated words from BIP39, the last of which is a random word. Run the system and see for yourself.

How to install REAL FINDS BITCOIN
It can be installed in any Python development environment. I recommend it on a Linux environment - Ubuntu 25


sudo apt install python3-venv

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install bip-utils mnemonic

python realfindbitcoin.py


If you find other dependencies on your system, install them if necessary.

Open the saldo.txt file and see for yourself all the private keys we found, many of them with balances we've already recovered, and all of them with 11 repeated words from the bip39-words.txt file (which must be in the same folder where the system will run) and just one random word, or in many cases, all 12 repeated words. This will directly impact everything you know about finding BITCOINS ON THE INTERNET, making your systems much more efficient and preparing you for a new way of seeing how the BITCOIN network really works.

WE ARE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO DISCOVER THIS INFORMATION AND PUBLISH THIS SYSTEM.

This is one of the wallets we found and as soon as you run the system you will find an identical wallet with the same data returned as in the SLAVO.TXT file
